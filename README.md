# Install
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/V10lator/linux-charcoal/releases/latest) and run the following on your Steam Deck:
```
cd ~/Downloads
sudo steamos-readonly disable
sudo pacman -U linux-charcoal-*-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst # Confirm when it asks you to remove linux-neptune-*
sudo steamos-readonly enable
rm linux-charcoal*
```
Note that you'll see erros like `==> ERROR: module not found: 'ata_generic'` but these are really just bad worded harmless warnings.
Reboot and check `uname -a` to see the new kernel. If the string contains `charcoal` installation worked correctly.
